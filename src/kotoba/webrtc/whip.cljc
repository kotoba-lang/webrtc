  "WHIP -- WebRTC-HTTP Ingestion Protocol (RFC 9725) -- as pure data.

  WHIP is how a browser publishes a single outbound media stream to an
  ingest server (Cloudflare Stream Live, Cloudflare Realtime, MediaMTX,
  Broadcast Box, Dolby, ...) over plain HTTP: one POST carries the SDP
  offer, the response carries the SDP answer plus a resource URL, and that
  resource URL is later PATCHed (trickle ICE) and DELETEd (teardown).

  Same contract as the rest of this library: no socket is opened, no
  `RTCPeerConnection` is touched, no HTTP client is required. Every
  function here maps data to data --

    request builders  : args           -> {:url :method :headers :body}
    response readers  : {:status :headers :body} -> parsed map
    `apply-event`     : session + event -> {:session :effects}

  -- and the host runtime supplies the transport and performs the effects,
  exactly as `kotoba.webrtc.session` does for peer-to-peer call signaling.
  This one models the *ingest* leg instead: one publisher, one server, no
  remote peer to negotiate with.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM."
